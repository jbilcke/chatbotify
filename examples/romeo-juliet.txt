Juliet: Romeo! 
Romeo: My dear?
Juliet: I have forgot why I did call thee back. 
Romeo: Let me stand here till thou remember it.
Juliet: Art thou not Romeo, and a Montague? 
Romeo: Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike. 
Juliet: O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?
Romeo: Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?
Juliet: By whose direction found'st thou out this place?
Romeo: By love, that first did prompt me to enquire. 
Juliet: Ay me!
Romeo: She speaks. What shall I swear by?
Juliet: Do not swear at all.
Romeo: O blessed, blessed night!
Juliet: Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.
Romeo: So thrive my soul
Juliet: A thousand times good night! 
Romeo: O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
Juliet: What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?
